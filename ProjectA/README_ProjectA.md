# Nutrient-Transporters of the agent of the Irish Famine.
> The study objective: identification of factors involved in the host-pathogen interaction establishment. 
Approach: a- characterization of nutrient transport families/genes in the pathogen, b- differential gene expression analysis of the identified nutrient transporters in the pathogen obtained from in vivo and ex vivo conditions

## General info
The identified novel pathogenic nutrient transporters have the potential to be used as tools for the design of disease control strategies for this historic plant pathogen.
