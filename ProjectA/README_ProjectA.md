# Nutrient-Transporters of the agent of the Irish Famine.
> The study objective: identification of factors involved in the host-pathogen interaction establishment. 
Approach: a- characterization of nutrient transport families/genes in the pathogen, b- differential gene expression analysis of the identified nutrient transporters in the pathogen obtained from in vivo and ex vivo conditions

## General info
The identified novel pathogenic nutrient transporters have the potential to be used as tools for the design of disease control strategies for this historic plant pathogen. 

## Irish Famine

## Gene Expression
### Packages
gplots, RColorBrewer, gtools

#### Code Example
       heatmap.2(yourdata, cexRow=1, cexCol=1, margins=c(6,6),lhei=c(0.2,0.9),lwid=c(3.5,2),density.info="none",trace="none",dendrogram="none",Colv="FALSE",notecex = 0.01,col=colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9,&quot;YlOrRd&quot;))(300), offsetRow=-0.5) #color brewe is used
