## General info
You have collected data and it is the BIG DATA that you have now! Congratulation? But, what is the next step? Or what is your next question? To address your next move you need to  discover hidden paterns, corelations, and come to the point that you can visualize your data depiting the new opportunities for the future step(s) and accomplishments.

## Big Data

## Project A
[Pathogen control: README](./ProjectA/README_ProjectA.md) 
##### The in vivo upregulated nutrient transports of the pathogen may be involved in the virulence of the pathogen.



#### Differential gene expression analysis
Analysis on RNA-seq data obtained from the pathogen grown in host tissues vs in vitro cultures

#### The nutrient transporters have distinct gene expression profiles
The image depicts the gene expression for the memebers of nutrient transporter families from in vivo and n vitro grown conditions.
